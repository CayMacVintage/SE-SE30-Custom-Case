# Variant 1

This variant has NO FloppyEMU at the front of the case. The cradle for the FloppyEMU is still on the inside.
This variant has no connection for a power amplifier for the audio. You will have to join the cables together for the 2 speakers and connect
them direclty to the audio output on the logic board.

We print on a Bambu A1 using PLA and default settings.
The base does need tree support manual and painted to mark the SCSI and Floppy ports on the rear. The other openings do not require supports.
